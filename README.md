# The Farmer Was Replaced

This game is a cool game for learning programming via a Python-like language.

This git repository records my own solution to the game.

It can be cloned in the location of the app's saves. On Windows:
```
C:\Users\<UERSNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\TheFarmerWasReplaced\TheFarmerWasReplaced\Saves\Save0
```
