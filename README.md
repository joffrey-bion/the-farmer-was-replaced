# The Farmer Was Replaced

[The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/) is a cool game for learning programming via a Python-like language.

This git repository records my own solution to the game.

It can be cloned in the location of the app's saves. On Windows:
```
C:\Users\<UERSNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\TheFarmerWasReplaced\TheFarmerWasReplaced\Saves\Save0
```
